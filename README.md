In this project, I utilized "HTML", "CSS", and "JavaScript" with the "Bootstrap" framework to enhance coordination and design. I used "Git" and "GitHub" for version control and tracking changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if necessary. Additionally, I integrated a public API to implement core functionalities.
